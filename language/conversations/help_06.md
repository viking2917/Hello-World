How do you work?
* request_for_help

< I know a fair amount about books and what they are about. You can tell me the name of a book you liked (ideally including the author's name), and I'll tell you about some books that might
be good followups. Or you can ask what's popular right now.
* help

< For example you can say "I loved Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins", or "What's popular right now?" (and that's all the help I have right now).
